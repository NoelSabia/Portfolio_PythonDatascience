1. Choose which Dataset you would like to watch
2. Choose which Data should be visualized

# Why?
To gain some experience with Pandas and Matpotlib/Seaborn. Moreover, to test my knowledge of classes and python in generell.

# Data
## Where you can get (interesting) .csv files
I used [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to get my hands on some useful Data. Follwoing Datasets were used:
- [Car_Sales.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/missionjee/car-sales-report)
- [Salary_Data.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data?rvi=1)

## What I wanted to extract from the data
### Car Sales
- Gender vs. Transmission
- Annual Income vs. Price($)
- Trend for selling Cars (2 year period)

### Salary Data
- Age vs. Years of Experience vs. Salary
- Education Level vs. Gender vs. Salary
